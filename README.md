# Deep-Learning-Study-of-Fluid-Flow-in-Porous-Media

This work is a follow-up research on our previous publication, <a href="https://github.com/DanialArab/Random-Forest-Classifier-to-Characterize-Emulsions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link to its repo</a>. In this work, deep learning approach was applied to perform the semantic segmentation of microfluidic chips (please visit <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920410522007045?via%3Dihub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for further details on the technical/non-ML parts). This approach is specifically useful when there is a high interaction between the injected chemical and the resident fluid. In these cases, there could be a high chance of complex emulsification (where there is not a sharp interface between the emulsified and the continuous phase, see red rectangle in figure below). In these cases, traditional ML algorithms may not be the best option for the pixel-level semantic segmentation and the fluid saturations may be overestimated: random forest is overestimated the oil saturation in the red rectangle. However, the segmentation accuracy is remarkably improved and the oil saturation in the same region (marked in the red rectangle) is precisely segmented. The intersection over union obtained for the testing datasets is averaged to ~97%.
