# Deep-Learning-Study-of-Fluid-Flow-in-Porous-Media

This work is a follow-up research on our previous publication, <a href="https://github.com/DanialArab/Random-Forest-Classifier-to-Characterize-Emulsions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link to its repo</a>. In this work, deep learning approach was applied to perform the semantic segmentation of microfluidic chips (please visit <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0920410522007045?via%3Dihub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> for further details on the technical/non-ML parts). This approach specifically useful when there is a high interaction between the injected chemical and the the residence fluid. In these cases, there could be a high chance of emulsification, where traditional ML algorithms may not be the best options for the pixel-level semantic segmentation. In these cases,
